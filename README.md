# hello-world

Programming is my passion since I learned computer programming with Fortran and Basic in the 80’s as a student of Chemistry at the “Universidad Industrial de Santander” at Bucaramanga, Colombia.  Then computers were My favorite tool for learning and Working.  In 1993, I Was a  founder partner of the Technical Institute of training in Informatic “System Plus de Colombia Ltda.”, which tradename was changed to “Sistemas Interactivos de Colombia Ltda.” in 2007.

In 1996 I  learned Unix and Learned Shell Programming. At the beginning of 1997 I heard about Linux. I downloaded and Installed on My PC and I “fall in Love” with Linux.  Since then I am passionate about open source software and a self-taught to learn Linux Networks and Web Development.

In my Job at “System Plus” I became responsible for developing its Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once finished this, I assume the administration of the Website and I began to teach Web Development, in 2000.  I learned PHP and MySQL in 2006 and I setup the platform of eLearning for “Sistemas Interactivos” with Moodle.

I led the teams in developing a new Web site and the Academic Information System for “Sistemas Interactivos” with PHP and MySQL in 2007. Since 2011, despite being the director of "Sistemas Interactivos", I was responsible for the administration and updating of these.
