Programming is my passion since I learned computer programming with Fortran and Basic in the 80’s as a student of Chemistry at the “Universidad Industrial de Santander” at Bucaramanga, Colombia.  Then computers were My favorite tool for learning and Working.  In 1993, I Was a  founder partner of the Technical Institute of training in Informatic “System Plus de Colombia Ltda.”, which tradename was changed to “Sistemas Interactivos de Colombia Ltda.” in 2007.

In 1996 I  learned Unix at My Job as Chemist at the Secretary of Water and Environment at the “Departamento de Santander”, in Colombia and Learned Shell Programming. At the beginning of 1997 I heard about Linux. I downloaded and Installed on My PC and I “fall in Love” with Linux.  Since then I am passionate about open source software and a self-taught to learn Linux Networks and Web Development.
